This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js that use server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue arises because Tailwind's purge functionality might not correctly identify and remove unused styles during the build process, leading to larger-than-expected CSS bundles.  This is often exacerbated when using dynamic class names or component composition which are difficult to statically analyze. For example:

```javascript
// In a Next.js component
function MyComponent({ className }) {
  return <div className={`p-4 ${className}`}></div>;
}
```

Here `className` is dynamically determined and might not be correctly purged.
